# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic paper-and-pencil game played by two players, traditionally using a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is for one player to mark three consecutive squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally with their symbol (usually X or O) before the opponent does. The game typically starts with an empty grid, and players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square until one player achieves the winning condition or the grid is filled, resulting in a draw.

Tic-tac-toe is a simple yet engaging game that is often used for educational purposes to teach basic strategic thinking and planning skills. Despite its simplicity, tic-tac-toe has a finite number of possible game states, making it possible to compute all possible outcomes and determine optimal strategies. However, due to its limited complexity, perfect play often results in a draw. Nevertheless, variations of tic-tac-toe exist, such as larger grid sizes, different win conditions, or the introduction of additional rules, to increase the game's complexity and strategic depth. Additionally, with the advent of computers and artificial intelligence, tic-tac-toe has been extensively studied as a benchmark problem for developing algorithms and evaluating computational strategies in game theory and artificial intelligence research.
